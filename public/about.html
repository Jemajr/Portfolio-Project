<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Greetings! I'm a freshman immersing myself in the realm of computer science,
  and I'm already leaving my mark in both technological innovation and community
  leadership. Serving as a technology and design intern at Grambling State
  University's College of Business, I've spearheaded the creation of our
  inaugural newsletter, "BizTalk," utilizing Constant Contact to communicate our
  vision effectively. Additionally, my role as the Community Service Chair for
  our NSBE chapter underscores my commitment to fostering a culture of service
  and collaboration within our academic community.
</p>

<p>
  My achievements within NSBE reflect my dedication and proficiency in the
  field. Winning the "Most Impactful New Member" award at the Region V Spring
  Zone Meeting, followed by the esteemed "Outstanding Technologist" recognition
  at Grambling's NSBE chapter awards Gala, underscores not only my technical
  expertise but also my ability to effect positive change and lead by example.
</p>

<p>
  Presently, I am actively seeking opportunities for software engineering
  internships, eager to apply my blend of technical acumen and
  community-oriented mindset to real-world projects. With a proven track record
  of excellence and a steadfast commitment to both technological advancement and
  community engagement, I am poised to make meaningful contributions to any
  organization that welcome me aboard.
